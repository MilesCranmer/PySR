    """Run symbolic regression to fit f(X[i, :]) ~ y[i] for all i.
    Note: most default parameters have been tuned over several example
    equations, but you should adjust `threads`, `niterations`,
    `binary_operators`, `unary_operators` to your requirements.

    :param X: np.ndarray, 2D array. Rows are examples, columns are features.
    :param y: np.ndarray, 1D array. Rows are examples.
    :param threads: int, Number of threads (=number of populations running).
        You can have more threads than cores - it actually makes it more
        efficient.
    :param niterations: int, Number of iterations of the algorithm to run. The best
        equations are printed, and migrate between populations, at the
        end of each.
    :param ncyclesperiteration: int, Number of total mutations to run, per 10
        samples of the population, per iteration.
    :param binary_operators: list, List of strings giving the binary operators
        in Julia's Base, or in `operator.jl`.
    :param unary_operators: list, Same but for operators taking a single `Float32`.
    :param alpha: float, Initial temperature.
    :param annealing: bool, Whether to use annealing. You should (and it is default).
    :param fractionReplaced: float, How much of population to replace with migrating
        equations from other populations.
    :param fractionReplacedHof: float, How much of population to replace with migrating
        equations from hall of fame.
    :param npop: int, Number of individuals in each population
    :param parsimony: float, Multiplicative factor for how much to punish complexity.
    :param migration: bool, Whether to migrate.
    :param hofMigration: bool, Whether to have the hall of fame migrate.
    :param shouldOptimizeConstants: bool, Whether to numerically optimize
        constants (Nelder-Mead/Newton) at the end of each iteration.
    :param topn: int, How many top individuals migrate from each population.
    :param nrestarts: int, Number of times to restart the constant optimizer
    :param perturbationFactor: float, Constants are perturbed by a max
        factor of (perturbationFactor*T + 1). Either multiplied by this
        or divided by this.
    :param weightAddNode: float, Relative likelihood for mutation to add a node
    :param weightInsertNode: float, Relative likelihood for mutation to insert a node
    :param weightDeleteNode: float, Relative likelihood for mutation to delete a node
    :param weightDoNothing: float, Relative likelihood for mutation to leave the individual
    :param weightMutateConstant: float, Relative likelihood for mutation to change
        the constant slightly in a random direction.
    :param weightMutateOperator: float, Relative likelihood for mutation to swap
        an operator.
    :param weightRandomize: float, Relative likelihood for mutation to completely
        delete and then randomly generate the equation
    :param weightSimplify: float, Relative likelihood for mutation to simplify
        constant parts by evaluation
    :param timeout: float, Time in seconds to timeout search
    :param equation_file: str, Where to save the files (.csv separated by |)
    :param test: str, What test to run, if X,y not passed.
    :param maxsize: int, Max size of an equation.
    :returns: pd.DataFrame, Results dataframe, giving complexity, MSE, and equations
        (as strings).
